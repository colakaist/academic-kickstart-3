title: "Electrochemistry at electrified interfaces"
summary: "Recently, a number of studies have found that electrochemical processes in batteries and electrolyzers are highly sensitive to the electrified solid-liquid interface. In addition, increasingly complex catalyst materials, such as carbon materials, single atom catalysts, 2D materials (MoS2, etc.) or semiconductors have been used. So far, adsorption energies of reaction intermediates have been used to rationalize catalyst activities on such materials, while the influence of the bias potential and solvation environment has been ignored. In this project, a recently published QM/MM framework4,5 will be applied to evaluate these materials under realistic environmental conditions. This comprises the optimization of force field parameters and the usage of a currently developed charging scheme. Eventually reactions will be modeled at these interfaces and conclusions drawn about activity descriptors which will lead to generalized catalyst and electrode material design principles.

Recently, a number of studies have found that electrochemical processes in batteries and electrolyzers are highly sensitive to the electrified solid-liquid interface. In addition, increasingly complex catalyst materials, such as carbon materials, single atom catalysts, 2D materials (MoS<sub>2</sub>, etc.) or semiconductors have been used. So far, adsorption energies of reaction intermediates have been used to rationalize catalyst activities on such materials, while the influence of the bias potential and solvation environment has been ignored. In this project, a recently published QM/MM framework4,5 will be applied to evaluate these materials under realistic environmental conditions. This comprises the optimization of force field parameters and the usage of a currently developed charging scheme. Eventually reactions will be modeled at these interfaces and conclusions drawn about activity descriptors which will lead to generalized catalyst and electrode material design principles.
